# AI Assistant Specification - VeriSimDB Debugger

## Status: Alpha Development (5% complete, not functional)

**VeriSimDB Debugger** is a Terminal UI (TUI) debugger for VeriSimDB, planned for v2.0 release. Currently in **alpha scaffolding phase** - project structure exists but no working features yet.

## Machine-Readable Artefacts

Check `.machine_readable/` directory for structured project context:

- **STATE.scm** - Current state (5% complete, blockers: VeriSimDB API not ready)
- **ECOSYSTEM.scm** - Relationship to VeriSimDB (debugging/observability layer)

Read STATE.scm first to understand current blockers before proposing work.

## Key Blockers (as of 2026-01-22)

1. **VeriSimDB v1.0 API not implemented** - No API to connect to
2. **API specification not finalized** - Don't know what endpoints exist
3. **TUI design not prototyped** - Unclear what views to build

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Rust (edition 2024)
- **TUI**: Ratatui + Crossterm
- **Async**: Tokio
- **HTTP**: reqwest

## What This Tool Will Do (v2.0)

- Query tracing (step through VQL execution, timing breakdowns)
- Drift visualization (cross-modal drift detection with diff views)
- Proof inspection (ZKP proof details, verification steps, circuit visualization)
- Federation debugging (multi-store coordination traces, consensus logs)

## What NOT to Do Yet

- Don't implement TUI views without API spec
- Don't write API client code without VeriSimDB v1.0
- Don't create mock data structures that may not match real API

## Next Steps (After VeriSimDB v1.0)

1. Get VeriSimDB API specification
2. Design TUI mockups
3. Implement API client with mock server
4. Build TUI views incrementally
